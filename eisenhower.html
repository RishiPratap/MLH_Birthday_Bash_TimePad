    <p>Eisenhower served as <strong>Supreme Commander of the Allied forces</strong> during <strong>World War II</strong> and later led NATO. 
        During his career, he frequently had to take many difficult decisions; everything was urgent and important. 
        He wondered what urgency meant exactly and reached the conclusion that if it didn't need to be done today, it wasn't urgent. 
        Pressing matters take precedence, but if they can wait until tomorrow, they're no longer urgent.
